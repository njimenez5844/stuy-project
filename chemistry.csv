Oxidation is always accompanied by reduction,  giving oxidation-reduction, or redox, reactions. Many metals are oxidized by O2, acids, and salts. The redox reactions between metals and acids as well as those between metals  and salts are called displacement reactions. The products of these displacement reactions are always an element 1H2 or a metal) and a salt.  Comparing such reactions allows us to rank metals according to their  ease of oxidation. A list of metals arranged in order of decreasing ease  of oxidation is called an activity series. Any metal on the list can be  oxidized by ions of metals 1or H+2 below it in the series. CONCENTRATIONS OF SOLUTIONS (SECTION ", "Chemistry"
" The concentration of a solution expresses the amount of a solute dissolved in the  solution. One of the common ways to express the concentration of a  solute is in terms of molarity. The molarity of a solution is the number  of moles of solute per liter of solution. Molarity makes it possible to  interconvert solution volume and number of moles of solute. If the  solute is a liquid, its density can be used in molarity calculations to  convert between mass, volume, and moles. Solutions of known molarity can be formed either by weighing out the solute and diluting it  to a known volume or by the dilution of a more concentrated solution  of known concentration (a stock solution). Adding solvent to the  solution (the process of dilution) decreases the concentration of the  solute without changing the number of moles of solute in the solution 1Mconc * Vconc = Mdil * Vdil2. SOLUTION STOICHIOMETRY AND CHEMICAL ANALYSIS  (SECTION ", "Chemistry"
" In the process called titration, we combine a solution of  known concentration (a standard solution) with a solution of unknown  concentration to determine the unknown concentration or the quantity  of solute in the unknown. The point in the titration at which stoichiometrically equivalent quantities of reactants are brought together is called  the equivalence point. An indicator can be used to show the end point of  the titration, which coincides closely with the equivalence point.

(Assume that  the products do not dissolve in chloroform.) [14.118] The reaction between ethyl iodide and hydroxide ion in  ethanol 1C2H5OH2 solution, C2H5I1alc2 + OH- 1alc2 ¡ C2H5OH1l2 + I - 1alc2, has an activation energy of  86.8 kJ>mol and a frequency factor of 2.10 * 1011 M-1 s-1. (a) Predict the rate constant for the reaction at 35 °C. (b) A  solution of KOH in ethanol is made up by dissolving 0.335  g KOH in ethanol to form 250.0 mL of solution. Similarly, 1.453 g of C2H5I is dissolved in ethanol to form 250.0  mL of solution. Equal volumes of the two solutions are  mixed. Assuming the reaction is first order in each reactant, what is the initial rate at 35 °C? (c) Which reagent in  the reaction is limiting, assuming the reaction proceeds to  completion? (d) Assuming the frequency factor and activation energy do not change as a function of temperature,  calculate the rate constant for the reaction at 50 °C.  [14.119] You obtain kinetic data for a reaction at a set of diferent  temperatures. You plot ln k versus 1>T and obtain the following graph: what familiar compound of hydrogen and oxygen does it  appear similar?  [14.122] The rates of many atmospheric reactions are accelerated  by the absorption of light by one of the reactants. For example, consider the reaction between methane and chlorine to produce methyl chloride and hydrogen chloride: Reaction 1: CH41g2 + Cl21g2 ¡ CH3Cl1g2 + HCl1g2  This reaction is very slow in the absence of light. However,  Cl21g2 can absorb light to form Cl atoms: Reaction 2: Cl21g2 + hv ¡ 2 Cl1g2  Once the Cl atoms are generated, they can catalyze the  reaction of CH4 and Cl2, according to the following proposed mechanism: Reaction 3: CH41g2 + Cl1g2 ¡ CH31g2 + HCl1g2 Reaction 4: CH31g2 + Cl21g2 ¡ CH3Cl1g2 + Cl1g2  The enthalpy changes and activation energies for these  two reactions are tabulated as follows: Reaction ∆H ° 1kJ,mol2 Ea 1kJ,mol2 3 +4 17 4 -109 4  (a) By using the bond enthalpy for Cl2 (Table 8.4), determine the longest wavelength of light that is energetic enough to cause reaction 2 to occur. In which  portion of the electromagnetic spectrum is this light  found? (b) By using the data tabulated here, sketch a  quantitative energy profile for the catalyzed reaction  represented by reactions 3 and 4. (c) By using bond enthalpies, estimate where the reactants, CH41g2 + Cl21g2, should be placed on your diagram in part (b). Use  this result to estimate the value of Ea for the reaction  CH41g2 + Cl21g2 ¡ CH31g2 + HCl1g2 + Cl1g2. (d) The  species Cl(g) and CH31g2 in reactions 3 and 4 are radicals,  that is, atoms or molecules with unpaired electrons. Draw  a Lewis structure of CH3, and verify that it is a radical.  (e) The sequence of reactions 3 and 4 comprises a radical chain mechanism. Why do you think this is called a  “chain reaction”? Propose a reaction that will terminate  the chain reaction. [14.123] Many primary amines, RNH2, where R is a carboncontaining fragment such as CH3, CH3CH2, and so on,  undergo reactions where the transition state is tetrahedral. (a) Draw a hybrid orbital picture to visualize the  bonding at the nitrogen in a primary amine (just use a C  atom for “R”). (b) What kind of reactant with a primary  amine can produce a tetrahedral intermediate?  [14.124] The NOx waste stream from automobile exhaust includes  species such as NO and NO2. Catalysts that convert  these species to N2 are desirable to reduce air pollution.  (a) Draw the Lewis dot and VSEPR structures of NO, NO2, and N2. (b) Using a resource such as Table 8.3, look up the  energies of the bonds in these molecules. In what region  of the electromagnetic spectrum are these energies? (c)  Design a spectroscopic experiment to monitor the conversion of NOx into N2, describing what wavelengths of  light need to be monitored as a function of time.  [14.125] As shown in Figure 14.23, the first step in the heterogeneous hydrogenation of ethylene is adsorption of the  ethylene molecule on a metal surface. One proposed  1/T ln k  Suggest a molecular-level interpretation of these unusual  data. 14.120 The gas-phase reaction of NO with F2 to form NOF and F  has an activation energy of Ea = 6.3 kJ>mol. and a frequency factor of A = 6.0 * 108 M-1 s-1. The reaction is  believed to be bimolecular: NO1g2 + F21g2 ¡ NOF1g2 + F1g2  (a) Calculate the rate constant at 100 °C. (b) Draw the  Lewis structures for the NO and the NOF molecules, given that the chemical formula for NOF is misleading because the nitrogen atom is actually the central atom in  the molecule. (c) Predict the shape for the NOF molecule.  (d) Draw a possible transition state for the formation of  NOF, using dashed lines to indicate the weak bonds that  are beginning to form. (e) Suggest a reason for the low activation energy for the reaction.  14.121 The mechanism for the oxidation of HBr by O2 to form  2 H2O and Br2 is shown in Exercise 14.74. (a) Calculate the  overall standard enthalpy change for the reaction process. (b) HBr does not react with O2 at a measurable rate  at room temperature under ordinary conditions. What  can you infer from this about the magnitude of the activation energy for the rate-determining step? (c) Draw a  plausible Lewis structure for the intermediate HOOBr.
